# Change Log for coreHTTP Client Library

## v1.0.0 November 2020

This is the first release of the coreHTTP client library in this repository.

The HTTP client library is a client-side implementation that supports a subset
of the HTTP/1.1 protocol. It is optimized for resource-constrained devices, and
does not allocate any memory.
